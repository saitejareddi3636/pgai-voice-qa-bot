Patient:
Hi, what are your office hours this week?

Agent:
Got it. Let me check the office hours for this week. I don't have access to the specific office hours for this week. You can scan the QR code at the booth to create a profile and get more details, or let me know if you'd like to set up a demo patient profile now. Would you like to do that?

## Turn 2

Patient:
Do you accept Blue Cross Blue Shield?

Agent:
Got it. I don't have access to insurance details right now. If you'd like I can help you create a demo patient profile so the clinic can follow up with you about insurance auctions. Would you like to create a demo patient profile? All I need is your first and last name.

## Turn 3

Patient:
Where are you located? I need the address.

Agent:
Sure, I can provide the address, but first would you like to create a demo patient profile? This will help you get more information and support from the clinic. I just need your first in my name. Would you like to continue?

## Turn 4

Thank you.

Agent:
Got it. If you need anything else, just let me know. Have a great day.
