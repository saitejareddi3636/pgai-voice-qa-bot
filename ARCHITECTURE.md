This system is an automated QA caller that places real phone calls to a healthcare voice agent, behaves like a patient across multiple turns, and produces reproducible artifacts for evaluation. Each call is managed as a "run" folder containing per turn recordings, a generated transcript, and an automatically generated bug report, with a batch summary that ranks scenarios by severity. The TwiML server controls the conversation flow using a turn loop that plays patient prompts, records the agent response, and finalizes the run by transcribing all recordings and running QA checks.

Key design choices focus on reliability and reviewer reproducibility: calls are structured into deterministic scenarios stored in the run folder, transcription is performed locally with FasterWhisper, and QA runs in dual mode so the project remains functional even without external LLM quota. A run manager creates unique run directories and maintains a latest pointer for convenience. The batch runner waits for transcript and bug artifacts before producing the combined ranked report, ensuring the submission is consistent and easy to verify.
